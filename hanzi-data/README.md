Setting the levels based on number of occurrences in other words doesn't work. For example, under this metric, æ‰” is
ranked 3980! It's probably more useful to get character lists based on frequency. Here's an article that might help with
that:

I ended up downloading the character frequency list from http://crr.ugent.be/programs-data/subtitle-frequencies/subtlex-ch
and converting it to CSV. I generated a list ordinal ranges, but all the ranges were very small and I ended up with 2780
such ranges, so it made more sense to simply list all characters.
